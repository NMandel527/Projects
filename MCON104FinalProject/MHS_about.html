    <h2>About Manhattan High School</h2>
    <article>
        <p>At MHS, we are dedicated to providing each student with an education for life. Together with our devoted faculty
        and esteemed parents, we work to ensure the academic, spiritual, and social success of our students by offering
        a broad range of classes, teachers, trips, and fellow students.</p>

        <p>The courses at MHS cover advanced topics in Torah learning and spiritual growth, alongside rigorous secular
        studies class. Students have the opportunity to take AP level courses to help prepare them for college. In addition
        to core class, in their Junior and Senior years, students have a broad selection of elective classes from which they
        can choose, based on their individual interests. It is our goal to ensure that each MHS student graduates with a well-rounded
        education that will prepare them for future success.</p>

        <p>Every faculty member at Manhattan High School is devoted to giving our students an everlasting education as well as serving
        as a role model for each of our students. Our Judaic Studies teachers are focused on providing our students with a deeper
        understanding of Torah and hashkafa, while teaching them how to implement these ideas and values into their own lives. Our
        Secular Studies department is geared towards educating our students in areas such as communication and culture, as well as
        the world of STEM.</p>

        <p>MHS is located in the center of NYC, which gives us the unique opportunity to take our students on several trips during
        the school day, bringing to life much of what they learn in their classes. With trips to museums such as the MET, the Frick,
        and the MOMA, tours at Lincoln Center, and lunch at Central Park, students get to experience the beauty of New York City, and
        the history and art within the walls of its most famous exhibits.</p>

        <p>MHS is a commuter school, which means that students come from all over the tri-state area. With girls from Manhattan, Brooklyn,
        The Five Towns, Queens, Monsey, Teaneck, and Passaic, our students become friends with girls from every community, not just their own.
        In addition, students can befriend girls in all grades because of the bus rides and community-wide events planned by both the school
        and the students themselves. Our girls call this the MHS family because they all come from many different places, but when they
        graduate, they know that not only have they gained an education for life, but they have made friends for life as well.</p>
