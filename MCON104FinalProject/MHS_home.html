        <p>Manhattan High School is focused on providing each student with a well-rounded education that will prepare
            them for their futures. The girls will experience a wide-range of opportunities throughout their high
            school years, including hearing from world-renowned speakers, visiting museums and art galleries, as well
            as choosing classes from a variety of electives based on their particular interests. As an institution that
            is committed to excellence, our students will graduate as confident and refined young women with a firm and
            steadfast dedication to Torah values, while still pursuing a professional career. It is our goal and our
            privilege to ensure the success and well-being of every member of the MHS family.</p>
